I am philo. You can know more about me on the [homepage](/) and my [vitae](../vitae/). This blog is about tech, life, and fun. I come here from time to time. All opinions expressed here are my own, and I don't represent anyone else.

I'm a graduate student in [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn), major in Software engineering. I earned my bachelor degree of Computer Science and Technology from the School of Computer Science, [Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications](http://cs.njupt.edu.cn). I have greate interest in reading books and exploring various subjects that I haven't heard about. In my spare time, I watch American dramas and British Dramas(not so often). Recently, I am trying to learn how to play guitar well. Currently, I am also a backend developer intern at [Tencent](http://www.tencent.com).
